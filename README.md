# Studio Scaffold for Mesop


Mesop scaffold for Studio style apps.

This is an example of a multi-page Mesop UX application, where:

* individual pages have their own state management while also having access to an application state
* Mesop custom components are used to facility app scaffolding, with side navigation and header
